NAME: elasticsearch
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Dec 21 17:19:02 2023
NAMESPACE: elastic
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
CHART NAME: elasticsearch
CHART VERSION: 19.13.10
APP VERSION: 8.11.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 WARNING

    Elasticsearch is only running one master node replica, assuming all the
    roles and with "single-node" discovery configured. If you want to scale up
    to more replicas, make sure you refresh the configuration of the existing
    statefulset. For example, scale down to 0 replicas first to avoid
    inconsistencies in the configuration:

      kubectl scale --namespace elastic statefulset elasticsearch-master --replicas=0
      helm upgrade --namespace elastic elasticsearch oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/elasticsearch --reset-values --set master.masterOnly=false

    Please note that the master nodes should continue assuming all the roles
    (master.masterOnly: false) since there is shard data on the first replica.

 WARNING

    Elasticsearch requires some changes in the kernel of the host machine to
    work as expected. If those values are not set in the underlying operating
    system, the ES containers fail to boot with ERROR messages.

    More information about these requirements can be found in the links below:

      https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/file-descriptors.html
      https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html

    This chart uses a privileged initContainer to change those settings in the Kernel
    by running: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144 && sysctl -w fs.file-max=65536

** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **

  Elasticsearch can be accessed within the cluster on port 9200 at elasticsearch.elastic.svc.cluster.local

  To access from outside the cluster execute the following commands:

    kubectl port-forward --namespace elastic svc/elasticsearch 9200:9200 &
    curl http://127.0.0.1:9200/
